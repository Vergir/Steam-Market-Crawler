# Steam-Market-Crawler #
Small utility to help with Steam Community Market

## Summary ##

This project is a client for interacting with Steam Community Market API (RESTful service basically).

It shows a couple of some basic web things, implemented in pure **C**, such as:

1. Forge and send full-fledged HTTP-request
2. Receive HTTP-Response
3. Parse JSON inside
4. Do some logic on received objects.

In it's current form it had capability of getting list of possible items from Steam API and some other auxiliary functions, although it's been a while since the last time somebody launched it and format has likely changed.
